# Simple virtual machine
To train my low-level skills a bit, I've choosen to implement a simple virtual machine

# Plan for the Opcodes
push-byte   nn
push-int    nn      // pushes a contant integer value on the stack

get-byte
get-int             // retrieves the integer located at the address on the stack

put-byte
put-int             // retrieves an integer and an address from the stack and moves the int there

add-byte
add-int

sub-int

mul-int

div-int

and-int

or-int
